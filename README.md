# Motion Detection in RaspberryPi

The application detects motion from Webcam and runs in Raspberry Pi.

## Why did I create this app?
Well, I am living with my uni mates far way from university area. And we all are leaving our place for Christmas holiday. You know, we need security thing :) 

## How it works?

When any motion is detected, the app sends an alert mail to the user and start to save video frames to your server/cloud server.
I am using Mixture of Gaussian algorithm for detecting differences between video frames.

## How to configure the app to your Raspberry Pi ?

- Coming Soon ...
