# Motion Detection in RaspberryPi

The application, run in Raspberry Pi, detects motions and record them.

## Why did I create this app?
Well, I am living with my uni mates far way from university area. And we all are leaving our place for Christmas holiday. As you think, we need security thing :) 

## How it works?

When any motion is detected, the app sends an alert mail to the user and upload video frames to your server/cloud server. As soon as the frames are uploaded, they will be deleted from a storage of Raspberry PI.   
I am using Mixture of Gaussian algorithm for detecting differences between video frames.

## How to configure the app to your Raspberry Pi ?

- Coming Soon ...
